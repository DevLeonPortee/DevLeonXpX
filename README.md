## About Me: 

Hello! I am currently a dedicated student, passionately working towards obtaining my education with a focus on data analysis. My academic journey is geared towards the ultimate goal of becoming a Data Scientist or Engineer. I am deeply interested in the power of data and how it can be harnessed to drive decision-making and innovation. I am committed to learning and developing the necessary skills to analyze, interpret, and manage data effectively. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in my career path and am eager to contribute to the field of data science.

# Skills: 

Certainly! I am currently honing my skills in SQL (Structured Query Language), a standard language for managing and manipulating databases. My proficiency in SQL includes creating and managing databases, writing queries to retrieve and manipulate data, and optimizing database performance. This expertise forms a crucial part of my skill set as a budding Data Scientist/Engineer, enabling me to handle, analyze, and derive insights from large datasets. I am committed to further developing these skills and staying abreast of the latest advancements in database technologies.

# Projects: 

Absolutely! I am actively engaged in a variety of projects that span across different domains of data science. These projects are meticulously organized and stored in various repositories. As I progress through each project, I ensure to update the status and document my findings and methodologies employed. Upon completion of each project, a comprehensive documentation is prepared detailing the objectives, methodologies, data used, findings, and implications of the project. This rigorous practice not only aids in keeping track of my learning journey but also serves as a testament to my dedication and skills in data science. It also provides potential employers or collaborators an insight into my capabilities and work ethic. Please note that the completed projects will be documented and made available at the appropriate time upon their completion.

# Interests: 

As an aspiring data scientist, I am passionate about leveraging GitHub as a platform to document and share my learning journey. My interests span across various aspects of data science, including but not limited to:

## Data Collection & Cleaning: 

I am proficient in using tools like pandas and DPLYR for data manipulation, and I am constantly honing my skills in data collection and cleaning to ensure the data I work with is accurate and reliable.

## Descriptive Statistics & Data Visualization: 

I am currently learning descriptive statistics to better understand data distributions and patterns. I am also exploring data visualization techniques, including creating compelling visualizations for business growth

## Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning: 

I am keen on applying statistical analysis to interpret data and draw insights. Additionally, I am delving into the basics of machine learning to build predictive models and algorithms.
## Big Data Technologies: 

I am eager to learn more about big data technologies to handle and analyze large datasets effectively.
